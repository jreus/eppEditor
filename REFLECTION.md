Sema is a playground where you can rapid prototype mini-languages for live coding that integrate signal synthesis, machine learning and machine listening. `

# MIMIC Summer Workshop 2019

Goals.............

![](firstviz.mp4)




### What does the Browser offer?
* an extremely flexible platform ~~ javascript :-X  ~~ HTML ~~ css ~~ that can be molded and modified to one's heart's content


* technology with huge financial and community investment
   * Tensorflow.js, three.js, nearley.js etc... some things that are either difficult or impossible to smoothly integrate into SuperCollider


* known cultural quantity for an audience


* potential for writing -> rewriting text, image and other media


### What does this enable me to do?

__Music Composition?__

Seems like the sound synthesis & compositional toolkit in the browser is limited (?not necessarily a terrible thing, but doesn't generalize well)


__Speech and Storytelling__

Continued work in this direction... ?

__Storytelling__

* WordWeaving / Zeno's Paradoxes

__SEMA & ML__

potential teaching tool ~~~ want to start doing language-making study/making interventions.. The nearley grammar making is lovely :-)

highly transferrable skills/knowledge (HTML/CSS/Javascript)

heavy resource investment into new/cutting edge apis

sound & visuals via language making are a powerful way of exploring these APIs in an intuitive way, also for teachers to produce meta-language/environments for students to be able to explore these apis intuitively

__barriers to usage in daily artistic work?__

difficulty in bridging datasets & various media with the sandboxed environment of the browser/maximilian/tensorflow (or whatever the ML api du jour is in the future...)

complexity increases dramatically as your desires expand beyond the basic system (epp language + exposed Maximillian API)

the process of making your own language that deviates significantly from the epp language is extremely difficult and limits the artistic exploration of expressive language

styling/expressing/using the language is not easily customized (e.g. see Elina's performance)
